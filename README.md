# Text-journey
REQUIREMENTS:
Have python 3.10.4 or later installed (This is the earliest that I can guarantee that there wont be any errors regarding deprecated or miss modules)


COMPATIBILITY:
    I cannot guarantee Text journey to work on mac/linux. Text journey was made on Windows 10 using python 3.10.5
    This program will work with python 3.10.4, and maybe all of 3.10. I plan on keeping Text journey updated with the newest stable python release.
OTHER:
Please don't alter any core (config, saves, important character data) tables in any of the databases, I don't want anything to break on your end.
Text Journey


UPDATING:
You shouldn't see any database changes very often, but it could happen. When/if it happens, a template table/database will be provided to change the format of either the character tables or the world databases. I plan to make a database editor so that you don't have to get a database editor from somewhere else, but I don't know when I will get to it.

For any more information, see the in-game help menu or better yet the Wiki.
