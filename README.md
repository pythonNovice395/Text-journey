# Text-journey
COMPATIBILITY:
    I cannot guarantee Text journey to work on mac/linux. This program was made on Windows 10 using python 3.10.5
    This program will work with python 3.10.4, and maybe all of 3.10. I plan on keeping Text journey updated with the newest stable python release.
OTHER:
Please don't alter any core tables in any of the databases, I don't want anything to break on your end.

UPDATING:
You shouldn't see any database changes very often, but it could happen. When/if it happens, a template table/database will be provided to change the format of either the character tables or the world databases. I plan to make a tool so that you don't have to get a database editor from somewhere else, but I don't know when I will get to it.
